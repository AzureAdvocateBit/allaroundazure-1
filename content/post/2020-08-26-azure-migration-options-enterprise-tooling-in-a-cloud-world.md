As a rule, much of the migration efforts that cloud providers focus on are around individual workloads: How do we move that application? How do we repackage that app? How do we move that database? By design, this places a lot of burden on the customer to do whatever work needs to be done in order to get the workload moved. For large and medium enterprises, where there's a significant amount of investment in tools and operational practices, this cost can be too high, and can lead to slowed or even abandoned plans to migrate. What if we could facilitate the migration of the entire platform itself?
