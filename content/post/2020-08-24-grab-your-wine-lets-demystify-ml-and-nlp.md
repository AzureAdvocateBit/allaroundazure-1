In this episode we will learn how to use Machine Learning to predict wine prices, points, and variety from the text description. 

We will process the wine description text with the library "SciKit Learn" to create a Bag-of-Words Logistic Regression Multi-Classification model. 

If that didn't make sense then you are in the right place! 

If it did make sense join anyway because wine. 

After we build our models I will show how we deployed them using Azure functions and Static Web Apps.
