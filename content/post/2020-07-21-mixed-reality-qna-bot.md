Creating educational experiences with Mixed Reality can provide educators the ability to share holographic replicas of real-world objects without stepping foot outside the classroom. In this stream, we'll take a look at Monumental World Tour, an interactive HoloLens 2 app created with MRTK which displays monuments from around the world and includes facts about each monument. The app created during this stream uses QnA Maker to create a knowledge base of facts about each monument. Using the Azure Bot Service, the knowledge base is connected to a bot with a Direct Line Speech channel.
