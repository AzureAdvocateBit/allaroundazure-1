Chris is helping his scuba diving club to reduce administrative overhead, and he had a new challenge around lending dive gear. During this session he will join Brian to show him how to quickly create a PoC with [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor?WT.mc_id=aaa07-blog-chmaneu) and ASP.NET Web APIs. Discover how some Azure services - like CosmosDB and Blob storage - can help you build your apps faster.
