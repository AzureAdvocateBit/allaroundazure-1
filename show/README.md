# All Around Azure

A twice-a-week live simulcast across Twitch, Learn TV, and more that covers topics specifically about Azure. With guests such as Cloud Advocates, MVPs, and Product Representatives the content will reference related documentation and Learn modules.

Each episode is unique and provides numerous touch points and artifacts such as:

1. Twitch Stream (live)
2. Twitch Highlights (limited time)
3. YouTube (Permanently stored in a Channel 9 playlist)
4. Blog.allaroundazure.com (static website)
5. Dev.to article (for syndication)
6. Short form video (< 15 minutes)
7. Addtional channel considerations such as Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube live

### Ideas

Below are the degrees of retention induced from various type of learning.

|**Retention rate**|**Learning activity before test of knowledge**|
|---|---|
|**90%**|Teach someone else/use immediately|
|**75%**|Practice what one learned|
|**50%**|Engaged in a group discussion|
|**30%**|Watch a demonstration|
|**20%**|Watch audiovisual|
|**10%**|Reading|
|**5%**|Listening to a lecture|

Read, Hear, See, Say, Write, Do

How can we guide the audience through each of these?

By including short segments throughout the 90 minutes we inherently create specified "breaks" in the program. This will allow us to edit and create additional content in the form of short videos and promotional materials. Additionally we can specify more on what type of content we want to cover.

Example: Every guest needs to reference a Learn Module. A segment that focuses specifically on the learn module will highlight it and provide unique and shorter content. Maybe a game can be made that pits the guest against some of our viewers.

- Azure Dictionary Segments
  - Encourage CA's to create "commercials"
